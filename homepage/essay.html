              <h1>My Essay</h1>
                <p>I consider the deli near my house a part of my New York. The deli resembles a part of my New York because people from different backgrounds come together to form a melting pot. The deli is very accessible and reliable for anyone that lives in the five boroughs. The vibe in the deli also shows how it resembles a part of New York. Lastly, the options in the deli are practically endless.</p>
                <p>The deli is very accessible to me because it’s a five minute walk from my house. The deli is open all day so whenever I feel hungry I take a nice stroll to get something to eat. I remember the first time I went to the deli was in the sixth grade. It was really late but for some reason I was starving. I was walking around for a good twenty minutes looking for something to eat when I came across the deli. I walked inside and smiled knowing that this was going to be my go to place in the future. The deli had literally anything I could imagine so as a sixth grader I was loving and enjoying the plentiful amounts of food choices. Even till this day I go for a midnight stroll to get food from the deli. The deli relates with New York because for the most part everything in New York is a walkable distance. Also, the deli being open 24/7 shows that New York is the city that never sleeps and things in New York are easily accessible and reliable.</p>
                <p>When you walk into the deli you will be surprised to see so many people of all races and ethnicities congregated in one tiny place. The deli resembles a part of New York because New York has so much diversity that it's hard to not have people of all races and different backgrounds come together.  When you walk inside the deli you will find out that it is very chaotic and loud. You can hear customers ordering food and making small talk with other people. For the most part, people are usually rushing to get their food so they won’t be late for work. However, you will see older people walk into the deli actively seeking to have a conversation with someone. This shows how New Yorkers and people in the deli have very different personalities then other individuals and see the world in a different perspective than others.</p>
                <p>Everytime I walk into the deli it smells like burnt, crispy bacon being cooked. The smell of the bacon makes my stomach rumble and makes me forget about everything in a split second. I’m sure when other people walk into the deli they reminisce on the last thing that they got in the deli. When I walk into the deli my mind is already made up. I know that I should try other sandwiches but I feel like getting a bacon egg and cheese sandwich is a way of life for me. Sometimes I have a hard time choosing what snack or drink I should get with my meal. The optionality of things to get in the deli is plentiful so you have to be confident and willing to make the choice of what you want to eat. This relates with New York because New York has a lot of competition and options so you have to be willing to choose what you believe is the best.</p>
